# MagicWheelOfLuckPanel - This one is on hold at the moment and needs a lot of changes :)
Adds a panel to the Rust Plugin MagicPanel https://umod.org/plugins/magic-panel which is required to use this plugin
The WheelOfLuck will give a player a new item upon log in to your Rust server. You can configure what they get from
a list genrated from json. You can also set how many items they win upon log in. By default they can only get a new
item every 24hrs from when they first get an item
